<h2> Purpose </h2>

<p>
	Chanakya is a consulting firm started to assist large corporations, family owned businesses and start-ups with skills they may not possess within their firms. It is also to utilize knowledge and skills gained from one industry sector to another to make these businesses as effective as possible. These skills, often viewed as "intangible" skills, are also slightly un-affordable, especially in the lean periods. The idea is to make these skills accessible, cost-effictive and eventually be run this firm out of business! These skills listed below.

	<ul>
		<li>Modeling, Simulation and Data Analytics</li>
		<li>Novel Project Strategy, Option Study, and Risk Analysis</li>
		<li>Scientific Startup Support</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	 It is well known fact that every business, every project has to be carried out with a well-rounded approach taking into account all possible known factors and investigate the unknown factors. However, required diligence to all "parameters" affecting a business or project is often neglected due to associated high costs or lack of experience.
</p>

<p>
	 It should always be remembered that prevention is better than cure. Proper planning is essential, irrespective of the size of the work, should be encouraged at all costs. It should also be remembered that mathematics behind every work cannot be ignored. Its also best described by Chanakya, who like most human beings, never liked mathematics or diligence at the first place. However, Chanakya maynot know everything it claims, but it sure knows how to hire!

</p>

<h2> Vision </h2>

<p>
	Presently, Chanakya aims to cater to natural resources industry, in general and mining and metals, in particular. It plans to use the transferrable skillsets in other industry sectors and provide similar services.

	The sectors include:
	<ul>
		<li>Power</li>
		<li>Infrastructure</li>
		<li>Real Estate</li>
		<li>Retail</li>
	</ul>	

	Chanakya, a Canadian business entity, plans to be a multi-national corporation. Chanakya also takes pride in providing un-baised and un-prejudiced opinions about all issues, in its ken of knowledge.

</p>

<h2> Background </h2>

<p>
	Chanakya was an ancient Indian teacher, philosopher, economist, jurist and royal advisor. He is traditionally identified as Kauá¹­ilya or Vishnugupta, who authored the ancient Indian political treatise, the Arthashastra a text dated to roughly between the 3rd century BCE and the 3rd century CE. As such, he is considered the pioneer of the field of political science and economics in India, and his work is thought of as an important precursor to classical economics.His works were lost near the end of the Gupta Empire in the 6th century BCE and not rediscovered until the early 20th century.

	The firm would indeed follow his footsteps:
	<ul>
		<li>Chanakya The Simulator</li>
		<li>Chanakya The Strategist</li>
		<li>Chanakya The Scientist</li>
	</ul>

  <h1>Simulator</h1>
  
  <p>
   Simulator is used as an all encompassing term, which includes the skillsets listed below.
   <ul>
   	   <li>Modeling and Simulation</li>
   	   	<p>
   	   	Chanakya is proficient in modeling an simulation related to mining and metals. The services include:
   	   	<LI> Development and utilization of simulation tools to achieve operational excellence. The activites supported are planning, debottlenecking, evaluating investment options, cost and risk analysis. These tools are transferrable across various process industries to achieve goals, study financial and insurance trade cycles. The technologies utilized for the purpose are chemical/metallurgical first principles, discrete event simulation, monte-carlo. The tools which could be utilized for the purpose are commerical softwares like METSIM, FLEXSIM, complex spreadsheet models, and customized numerical solutions using programming languages such as VBA and Python. However, the license cost for commerical softwares for the time of use has to be borne by the clients </p>

   	   	<li>Data Analytics</li>

   	   	<p>Chanakya is proficient in advanced operational data analysis related to mining and metals. The services include accessing data from various sources utilized by businesses, analyze and draw high level inferences for a defined goal. The services would also include preliminary statistical testing and predictions utilizing tools such as linear regression, multi-linear regression etc. These skillsets are transferrable across various process, finance, insurance, and retail industries and departments. 

   	   		<LI> Excel </LI>
   	   		<p> Accessing data from PI, SAP BI, JSON, EDW (using SQL) and advanced analysis of datasets</p>
   	   		<LI> Python/R </LI>
   	   		<p> Utilizing machine learning libraries </p>
   	   		<LI> Softwares </LI>
   	   		<p> Utilizing softwares like SIMCA-P, which are based on partial least squares - discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and MiniTAB </p>


  <h2>Aryabhatt</h2>
  
  <p>The aim is to build a state-of-art metallurgical/mining simulator which can be used to debottleneck/troubleshoot industrial processes, develop operational efficiencies. It can also be used by management and operations consultants to study operational efficiencies and evaluation new investment options. This software would combine first principles (chemical), discrete event (DES), monte carlo, statistical (data science) modeling tools. The simulator can later be expanded into other process industries. While there are number of simulators in the market for different purposes, few simulators combines all the capabilities. The ones which do have all the capabilities are expensive and dont provide enough support to the clients, given the degree of complexity </p>
